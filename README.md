## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For fetch calls


### What I learned

This project helped to reinforce my foundation for the React library and for tailwind css styling. The project also provided my first experience with Axios. I learned how to process JSON information from a rest API and apply it to react components. One big take away from the project was how to deal with information that may or may not be present in the fetch request.
